# Microsoft 365 Admin Lab  

I built a small Microsoft 365 environment for my test company **ML Tech Services** to practice real IT admin tasks.  
This included adding users, resetting passwords, creating groups, assigning roles, and checking licenses.  

The aim was to get hands-on with Microsoft 365 so I can apply these skills in an IT support role.

## ‚úÖ What I Did
- Created two test users (**Alice Rivera** and **Eddie Hall**)  
- Practiced password resets (Eddie)  
- Made groups for collaboration (**All Staff**) and permissions (**IT-Support**)  
- Gave Alice the **Global Reader** admin role (least privilege example)  
- Checked security defaults and license assignments

## üìù Key Takeaways
Doing this lab showed me how Microsoft 365 admin works in practice, beyond just theory.  
I now understand:  
- User lifecycle management  
- Groups and permissions  
- Role-based access control  
- Security defaults and licensing

This was a good starting point, and next I‚Äôll expand into **Intune device management** and onboarding/offboarding workflows.
